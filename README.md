<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Augmented Reality or AR  is a term for portraying virtual 3D objects in  real-world environment. Learning using Augmented Reality enhances the view and experience of learning. This can be implemented for students of all ages from kindergarten to high school. AR adds objects, graphics, sounds and pictures to enhance the learning environment and lets a student be completely involved in the learning process.

Students can move around and see the virtual object or animation from different views and also give game based quizzes to have a complete understanding of the topic.

Teachers will be able to use the features of Augmented Reality to facilitate the process of teaching which will help the student pay more attention and have better understanding.

Children and students can explore different places from their room itself to relax and take their mind off through an Augmented Portal.
